Go Mapreduce for Appengine
==========================

This is a feature-complete (though not performance or reliability complete)
implementation of map/reduce for the go language on the appengine platform. It
make heavy use of task queues to provide load scaling, and a sample application
is available from `http://github.com/pendo-io/mapreduce-sample`.

This is an BETA release of this package. While it is being used for production use
it certainly still has shortcomings and bugs.
